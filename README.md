Back-end memo : 
‚àô For database size purposes, we are only looking for products from France.
‚àô In the database, id, product names and brands keys should not be empty otherwise it's impossible for the user to identify the product. 
‚àô It's fine if other fields are missing (such as stores, nutrient levels, nutrition grades tags and image), the user will be able to update them.
